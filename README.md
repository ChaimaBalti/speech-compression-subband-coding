# Speech Compression Using Subband Coding: A MATLAB Project

## Overview
This project focuses on the numerical signal processing of speech signals through compression techniques utilizing subband coding. The primary goal is to analyze, encode, and synthesize speech data, optimizing for efficiency and quality.

## Project Structure
```plaintext
speech-compression-subband-coding/
│
├── MP_TNS_SCRIPT.m            # MATLAB script for analyzing and encoding speech signals
├── unifquant.m                # MATLAB script for uniform quantization
├── RAPPORT_MP_TNS_2023.pdf     # Report detailing the project phases and results
└── README.md                  # Project overview and documentation
```

## Analysis Phase
The analysis phase involves the design and implementation of techniques for decomposing the speech signal into subbands and encoding it.

## Synthesis Phase
The synthesis phase reconstructs the speech signal from the compressed subband components.

## Getting Started
1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/speech-compression-subband-coding](https://github.com/ChaimaBalti/speech-compression-subband-coding.git
   ```
2. **Navigate to the project directory:**
   ```bash
   cd speech-compression-subband-coding
   ```
3. **Open MATLAB and run the scripts:**
   - Execute `MP_TNS_SCRIPT.m` for the analysis and encoding phase.
   - Execute `unifquant.m` for the uniform quantization process.

## Report
The detailed project report can be found in `RAPPORT_MP_TNS_2023.pdf`, which includes analyses, results, and insights on the implementation of speech compression techniques.
